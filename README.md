# notepad

A simple colorful notepad application written in Java.

## ✅ What is it — Overview

`notepad` is a lightweight Java-based text editor that lets you write and edit plain-text documents.  
It’s designed to be simple and easy to use — ideal for quick note-taking, editing code or writing drafts — without extra complexity.  
The code is contained in a single Java source file (currently `ColorfulNotepad.java`), making it easy to understand, compile, and extend.

## 📄 Features

- Plain text editing capability.  
- Basic editing functionality (open, edit, save — depending on how you build/extend it).  
- Simple and minimal UI (lightweight, minimal dependencies).  
- Entirely written in Java — easy to compile and run on any system with Java installed.  

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Java JDK (version 8 or higher recommended)  
- A terminal / command-line or IDE (e.g. IntelliJ, Eclipse) to compile/run  

## 🚀 How to Build & Run

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Nigusohm/notepad.git
cd notepad

# Compile (assuming ColorfulNotepad.java)
javac ColorfulNotepad.java

# Run
java ColorfulNotepad
(If compiled as part of a package or different structure, adjust commands accordingly.)

💡 Usage
Once launched, you can type or paste text, edit, and save — same as a basic notepad.
Because the project is simple and minimal, it can serve as a starting point if you want to add more features (e.g. copy/paste, find/replace, syntax highlighting, GUI enhancements, etc.)

✅ Why this project
Quick and light — no heavy frameworks or dependencies.

Good starting point for beginners — useful for learning Java I/O, GUI (if GUI used), or building small utilities.

Easy to read, modify, or extend — good educational value.
